# Contributing

Any kind of contributions are welcome:
* Participating in the discussions in the Gitter chat, issues or pull requests
* Improving documentation: updating, clarifying, extending it
* Submitting bug reports and bug fixes
* Proposing new features or general improvements

## Contribution Guidelines

* To submit a bug report or a feature request, open a new issue
* To propose a bug fix or a feature implementation, follow the standard [fork & pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) process
* Before submitting a pull-request it's recommended to discuss the idea with maintainers, either via an issue or in the Gitter chat. This will help you to spend less time on the implementation and prepare a pull-request which is more likely to be merged
* All code pull-requests should:
    - have a meaningful commit message description
    - comment important things
    - include tests
    - minimize changes not related to the subject of the pull-request (like changing code formatting)
